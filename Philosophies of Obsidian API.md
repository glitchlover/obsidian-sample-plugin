# Philosophies of Obsidian API
1. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   - The Obsidian API heavily relies on an event-driven model, allowing plugins to react to changes in the application state, (*such as file modifications, workspace layout updates, or metadata changes*). This ensures that plugins can dynamically adapt to user actions and system events.
2. **Modularity:**
   - Obsidian's architecture is built around modular components, (*such as `ItemView`, `Modal`, `Workspace`, and `Vault`*). Each component is self-contained, with clearly defined responsibilities, making it easier for developers to extend or customize specific parts of the application without affecting others.
3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - The API separates data management (e.g., Vault, MetadataCache) from UI interaction (e.g., Workspace, ItemView). This separation ensures that plugins can focus on either backend logic or frontend presentation independently, promoting clean and maintainable code.
4. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - The API provides lifecycle hooks (onload, onunload) and resource management tools (registerEvent, registerView) to ensure that plugins can clean up resources and maintain stability when enabled or disabled.
